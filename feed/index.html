<p>Eastchester, NY – <b>Miracom Computer Corp.</b>, the leading supplier of post-press production controls and software to the newspaper industry, has launched a software retrofitting service for newspaper production equipment, to assist newspaper publishers in upgrading and optimizing their operations. Utilizing its suite of affordable, integrated control and software systems, called <b>NewsWorx</b>, Miracom specializes in retrofitting older, unsupported newspaper packaging machines with updated and serviceable control software essential for modern newspaper fulfillment.</p>
<p>Founded in 1995, the company has deep roots in the efficiency-critical newspaper industry. For that highly deadline-oriented sector, Miracom provides tools to gather data on equipment efficiency and other crucial aspects of production, yielding opportunities to streamline operations and reduce avoidable slowdowns or other costly disruptions. The company’s modular, standalone solutions can be implemented separately or combined as one seamless system to improve productivity, reduce operating costs, monitor remote locations and minimize human errors.</p>
<p>Miracom’s NewsWorx solutions allow newspaper companies to save money while improving planning, post-press production and distribution efficiencies. The products comprising Miracom’s NewsWorx solutions are:</p>
<p><b>• MiraSERT:</b> A proven, state-of-the-art PC-based Inserter Control System used in hundreds of installations. MiraSERT utilizes internet-based monitoring and has the ability to process and deliver sophisticated insert packages complete with demographic capabilities.</p>
<p><b>• MiraLABEL:</b> The MiraLABEL inkjet control system improves productivity and cuts costs in addressing and labeling applications by printing directly on papers or packages as an inline operation. Imports address files and then formats and prints labels that can include postal barcodes and/or indicia.</p>
<p><b>• MiraPACKAGE:</b> An insert planning and inventory system designed to meet the demanding needs of newspaper production facilities. Offers control of insert orders, distribution and postal integration, inventory, and inserting production schedule.</p>
<p><b>• MiraSTORE: </b>An insert tracking and inventory system that reduces waste and creates accountability with barcode inventory tracking. Designed to offer improved inventory control to keep better track of inserts from initial order, receiving, warehousing and insertion.</p>
<p>“Our deep expertise and unique capabilities in retrofitting out-of-date newspaper printing machines with our modern, serviceable control software is a valuable service for newspaper publishers who rely on high-functioning production lines,” said Judah Holstein, Miracom President and Founder. “Frequently, it can be difficult to find servicing for antiquated machines, and the alternative of purchasing a replacement machine is an untenable cost. Our ability to integrate software solutions into older machinery is an ideal solution to streamline operations and avoid costly downtime.”</p>

<p>Eastchester, NY – <b>Miracom Computer Corp.</b>, the leading supplier of post-press production controls and software to the newspaper industry, has expanded its solutions portfolio into two new sectors: <b>packaging and material handling.</b> Called <b>PackWorx</b> and <b>MatWorx</b>, respectively, the company’s software products are tailored to help small- and medium-sized companies optimize their packaging and material handling operations. The five-product suite of affordable solutions is designed to boost equipment speed and performance, optimize production scheduling, incorporate track &amp; trace capabilities, implement in-line printing, and verify labeling accuracy and readability.</p>
<p>For Miracom, PackWorx and MatWorx represent a natural evolution. Founded in 1995, the company has deep roots in the efficiency-critical newspaper industry. For that highly deadline-oriented sector, Miracom provides tools to gather data on equipment efficiency and other crucial aspects of production, yielding opportunities to streamline operations and reduce avoidable slowdowns or other costly disruptions.

<p>The products comprising Miracom’s new PackWorx and MatWorx solutions are:</p>
<p><b>• MiraBOOST:</b> An integrated controls and software Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that provides internet-based remote monitoring, real-time reporting, and advanced data collection capabilities so companies can measure the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of specific machines, fully automated lines, or even multiple plants. Its benefits include machine synchronization, maintenance scheduling, line efficiency and lost downtime.</p>
<p><b>• MiraPACKAGE:</b> A cloud-based MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning) software system for planning, scheduling, and controlling production and inventory.</p>
<p><b>• MiraTRACE:</b> Track &amp; trace software with serialization and unlimited levels of aggregation. MiraTRACE is a cloud-based software system that provides traceability, product integrity, anti-counterfeiting and brand protection when paired with MiraJET or another inline printer, and MiraSCAN or other print verification equipment.</p>
<p><b>• MiraSCAN:</b> A label verification system that uses an inline camera with a printing device to verify that printed labels are accurate and readable. Designed to be plug-n-play compatible with Miracom’s MiraJet line of printers.</p>
<p><b>• MiraJET: </b>A thermal inkjet printer and control system for printing high resolution labels, bar codes, QR codes, sequence numbers, batch/lot numbers, expiration dates, and other variable data directly onto coated and non-coated surfaces.</p>
<p>“Our expanded solutions for the packaging and material handling sectors draw upon decades of experience providing efficiency, accuracy and verification software products in the newspaper sector, whose tight-window production schedules leave zero time for error,” said Judah Holstein, Miracom President and Founder. “Our planning, control and integration solutions will prove to be an ideal fit in these additional sectors, where streamlining production, simplified scheduling and strict quality assurance are becoming increasingly important.”</p>
